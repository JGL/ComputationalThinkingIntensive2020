					<p>Workshop 1: What do you want to get out of these workshops?</p>
				</section>

					<h3>What we are going to talk about now:</h3>
					<ol>
			            <li>The aim of these workshops.</li>
			            <li>Everyone states something they want from this workshop, no exceptions, no wrong answers.</li>
			            <li>Discussion.</li>
			            <li>Plan and schedule.</li>
			            <li>Bonus: adding this all to the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/ComputationalThinkingIntensive2020">GitHub Repository for the intensive (or GitHub Repo)</a>. Discussion of source control.</li>

					<h3>1. The aim of these workshops.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Give you as much practical experience (aka failure) to allow you to level up quickly.</li>
						<li>I want to show you how I make the workshop happen and record it as part of the workshop.</li>
						<li>I'm mostly going to code it live and then upload it to the web at the end of the workshop, then we'll continue next workshop.</li>
						<li>Having an organised way of recording what you are doing and your progress to your goal is just as important as choosing what your goal is.</li>
						<li>I started recording everything in text files after I had a disagreement on a project and couldn't prove what I said happened, happened. Practical experience!</li>
						<li>Pair work is encouraged.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>2. Everyone states something they want from this workshop, no exceptions, no wrong answers.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I will note responses live, as they happen. It will likely break the webpage HTML, so I will not change the live site until the end of the workshop - can someone remind me to do that?</li>
						<li>That is also my aim for this workshop, that someone reminds me to upload at the end of the workshop.</li>
						<li>Everyone states something they want from this workshop, no exceptions, no wrong answers. My AirDrop is also open, which I may regret. If you don't have an Apple phone, I'm sure you can find someone who has.</li>
						<li>Something interactive.</li>
						<li>How to make 3D models appear in website.</li>
						<li>Anything</li>
						<li>Anything</li>
						<li>World of creative coding - pros and cons - advantages of different languages, p5js?</li>
						<li>A starting point, knowing the possibilities</li>
						<li>Want to be employable - what are the possibilties</li>
						<li>Connection between visuals and sound - OSC - Open Sound Control</li>
						<li>Everything</li>
						<li>Inspiration for machine vision</li>
						<li>Potentionmeter to control frequency p5js - onscreen - how to make interfaces</li>
						<li>Something</li>
						<li>Make things look squishy - soft body dynamics - Box2D</li>
						<li>Improve on existing p5js projects</li>
						<li>Augmented Reality - ar.js - is p5js?</li>
						<li>Audio visual experiences - audio reactive things</li>
						<li>Basic knowledge of programming - I have ideas for simpler projects and I want to develop them, motion graphics and animation too, and make friends!</li>
						<li>Very big issues with technology in art! Can't criticise without knowledge!</li>
						<li>Why use p5js instead of processing?</li>
						<li>Working with visuals and transfer them into other medium, transferring to print or 3D printers or weaving!</li>
						<li>Data transformation, shifting from data set to another, light to sound, when use digital, when use analogue, use of digital, ethics of data use, public domain</li>
						<li>Augmented reality - really understand the medium, understand how the medium can be used to it's strengths, how can it highlight different meanings, how to make something that is digital and collectible. What does it mean that something could last that is digital? Is it disposable?</li>
						<li>Materiality?</li>
						<li>How can I integrate code with textiles</li>
						<li>Where the digital and physical and environments meet. Using the physical as a source of machine learning.</li>
						<li>Creating experiences that go beyond the digital - transforming a whole room in a digital way or using digital to do that.</li>
						<li>How can we create unpredictable outputs based on simple inputs?</li>
						<li>Create something that uses machine learning to appear to be alive</li>
						<li>Connecting touch designer to p5js or anything else!</li>
						<li>The work flow for getting my face into 3d for AR</li>
						<li>Reading a video frame into an array for interpretting</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Demo source control.</li>
						<li>Demo GitHub. Everyone should join! Good for career, any career.</li>
						<li>Demo route to changing the website, and pull requests.</li>
